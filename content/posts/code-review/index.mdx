About Code Review
Code Review is the practice of having other peers reviewing source code changes before it gets introduced into a baseline. Developers usually review their team members' code, although there are companies that promote cross-team reviews.

There are two kinds of Code Review:

Formal Code Reviews are comprehensive. They follow checklists and require reviewers to fill proper documents. They are structured, may contain a "score" to assess whether the changes should go further in the development flow. It's more used for mission-critical software.
Informal Code Reviews are more open to subjectiveness, as adopters prefer guidelines and conventions over checklists. Depending on the experience of the reviewer, the outcome of the process may vary.
The next classes focus on Informal Code Reviews, which became popular in the software industry and a consolidated step of the modern software development workflow. It is widely known, and the more companies are going digital, the more they are adopting this technique.
